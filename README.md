# MadGenerator

MadGenerator is my first attempt at making an NPM package. The name is what it sounds like - it is a generator, with "Mad" thrown in there because my name is Madyson. This package is certainly nothing fancy, and as of current, it generates preset directories/sub-directories for you via CLI. I have really enjoyed the learning process of creating this and look forward to doing more with it!

## Getting Started:

MadGenerator is an NPM package, so obviously must be installed via npm.

### Prerequisites:

You must be running the latest version of node.js

### Installation:

You can install MadGenerator on globally by running 
```
npm install -g madgenerator
```
Then install in a project directory with 
```
npm install --save madgenerator
```


### Use:

As of right now, there is one working CLI command. It will create two directories (src & public), and two sub-directories within src (components and reducers). Once you have MadGenerator saved to your project folder, use 
```
madgen-dirs
```
